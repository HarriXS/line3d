Started life as a joke in a computer science class, actually turned out to be a good idea.

Initially you would enter parameters for the object, and this would be transformed by some matricies then overwritten. (relative position)
I quickly realised the multiplying floating point errors would make it unusable, so I rewrote much of it to use absolute position relative to the center of the canvas.

Currently the perspective transormation used is NOT accurate. It is a bit of a work around and it distorts planes slightly
