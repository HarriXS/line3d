# line3d
Simple web based 3d engine I'm working on for fun.

Right now it's incredibly basic and more of a demo so likely not much point trying to adapt it to do anything meaningful.

any suggestions would be appreciated

You can change values like starting position, rotation speed and direction etc

You can also add objects to display. Put 3d coordinates (somewhere around 1 if you want it to display properly) into an array called 'points' and add list the indexes of the points to join into an array called 'instructions'. Examples in line3d.js
