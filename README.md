# line3d
# Simple web based 3d engine I'm working on for fun.

Displays objects as wireframe (currently)

Right now it's incredibly basic and more of a demo so likely not much point trying to adapt it to do anything meaningful.

start date 07/10/2020 (d/m/y)

any suggestions would be appreciated

You can change values like starting position, rotation speed and direction etc

You can also add objects to display. Put 3d coordinates (somewhere around 1 if you want it to display properly) into an array called 'points' and add list the indexes of the points to join into an array called 'instructions'. Examples in line3d.js

## Current Features:
* rotate an object on all 3 axes
* perspective
* that's it for now

## Coming (probably):
* accurate perspective
* hide/fade lines on back side of object
* shaded polygons
* translation
* dynamic viewpoints
* multiple objects
* animation features

more if I have the time
