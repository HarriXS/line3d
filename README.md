# line3d
## Simple web based 3d engine.

Displays objects as wireframe (currently)

Right now it's incredibly basic and more of a demo so likely not much point trying to adapt it to do anything meaningful.

Any suggestions would be appreciated

Currently you can change values like starting position, rotation speed and direction etc

You can also add objects to display. Put 3d coordinates (somewhere around 1 if you want it to display properly) into an array called 'points' and add list the indexes of the points to join into an array called 'instructions'. Examples in line3d.js

### Current Features:
* rotate an object on all 3 axes
* accurate perspective
* multiple objects (at center)
* coordinate system display

### Coming (probably):
* hide/fade lines on back side of object
* shaded polygons
* translation
* dynamic viewpoints
* animation features
* .obj file support

more if I have the time
